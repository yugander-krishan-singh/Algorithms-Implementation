This is very important.

Task is to use event emitter first in the backend such that you have two numbers. You will perform the following operations on each number:
- add
- subtract
- multiply
- divide

But all of these operations are asynchronous as they are independent. The thing is after each operation main thread will sleep for some time and once the each operation completes an event will be emitted with message that "corresponding event completed"

Task:
- Complete the above in backend(Java- spring boot) only(search google for examples. will find many)

- Complete the above with Angular 5 and Java.(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40987560/angular-2-spring-boot-server-side-events, https://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-2-custom-event-binding-eventemitter-example#steps)
